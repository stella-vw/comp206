Permissions
=============
Split into groups of 3: first is owner, second is group (excludes owner), third is everyone else (excludes owner and group)

Octal notation --> split each number and convert to binary then overlay with rwxr-x--x to see if have permission

	ex. 644 --> 110100100 --> rw-r--r--


Standard Streams
================

- program: something you can run on a computer
- process: a running instance of a program
	- each process has an ID num. called process ID (PID)

- each process is started by another process except for PID 1 which the kernel starts

- init systems: PID 1 programs
	- many Linux use systemd as init system

- each opened file gets ID num called file descriptor
- process A spawns a new process B --> A is the parent B is child
	- B inherits all the open file descriptors of its parents

- each process has 3 special file descriptors:
	- FD 0 --> standard input (stdin)
	- FD 1 --> standard output (stdout)
	- FD 2 --> standard error (stderr)
