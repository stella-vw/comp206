Shell wildcards
========================

- * -> match everything
	ex. *c --> any file ending in c
- ? -> match any single character
- [abc] -> match any sincgle character from the set 'abc'
	- ranges can by specified using a dash e.g. '[a-z]' -> any lowercase letter
	- can have multiple ranges
	- negate a set with a bang e.g '[!a-z] -> any char not lowercase

wildcards are evaluated in the shell not the script we are running.

- command; command -> executes both commands even if first fails
- command && command -> executes second only if first one successful
- command || command -> executes only first if successful, executes second if first fails
